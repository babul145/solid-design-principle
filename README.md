# SOLID Design Principles in Java with Example

**S = Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):** The single responsibility principle states that every java class must perform a single functionality.

**O = Open - Close Principle (OCP):** The open-close principle states that according to new requirements the module should be open for extension but close for modification.

**L = Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):** It applies to inheritance in such a way that derived classes must be completely substitutable for their base classes. 

**I = Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):** The interface segregation principle states that larger interfaces split into smaller ones.

**D = Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):** The dependency inversion principle states that we must use abstraction (abstraction classes and interfaces) instead of concrete implementations. High-Level module should not depend on low-level module but both should depend on the abstraction.
